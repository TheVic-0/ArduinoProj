This code is meant to be a tryout of a light monitoring system in which multiple LDRs could be utilized and the status from the LDR readings displayed on n LCD display
Another option would be to use LEDs as indicators to respond to the LDRs, becoming Red when the lighting is low or Green when the lighting is bright

Both the LCD or the LED Indicators can be switched On/Off independently by the user
