# ExtremeOut

### Explanation

A simple home automation program with the objective of closing doors and/or windows so that the heat/cold does not enter the home when the temperature
is too extreme for the residents

#
### Objective

This is a small scale program which could be scaled up to monitor the temperatures around the household and react accordingly so that the internal temperature is not highly 
affected by outside temperature variations, making living more comfortable and cost-effective since it also wont be checking the temperature every second but only 
every few minutes
