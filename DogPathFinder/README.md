# DogPathFinder

### Explanation

Inspired by my 17 year-old dog's problem of seeing in the dark, the program was made so that it can differ between people or the dog being near the door,
so when the dog is detected, the servo will open the pet door/flap automatically and wait for the dog to return to then close it.

Additionally the program also lights up an NeoPixel LED strip to assist the dog finding its path to the grass and back, closing the pet doot/flap a few seconds after
the dog crosses it and turns off all the NeoPixels in reverse order for a better effect

### Objective

The general idea is to automate events in which the dog can be let out without the need of human interaction and also assist the dog with finding the correct path by using LEDs
